the attention oi men in the first days oi the empire. It is
instructive to note the driit oi much oi their writing. In
Virgil’s Georgim, the composition oi which is said to have
been suggested by Maecenas, we have a glorification oi ltal-
ian agriculture. This had sadly deteriorated during the
warS, and its revival was one oi the aims ol Augustus's gov-

which the poets gained pecuniary or material remuneration
from their patrons was very small. Virgil's estate near
Mantua was, it is true, saved from confiscation by the influ-
ence oi Octavian, and Horace was presented by Maecenas
with a small farm in the Sabine country; but these are ex-
