6 SELECTIONS FR'OM OVID

their wool. In the Song of Orpheus, also, several dil-
ferent narratives are given. The figures made by
Minerva and Arachne in their weaving contest turnish
still another opportunity for the introduction ol a number

of fables.

Of the origin of these myths of transformation little
can be said here. By lar the greater part ol those in-
cluded by Ovid in his poem were taken by him from
Greek sources; but those in the later books are, as the
subjects indicate, distinctly Roman. Of the former, many
were doubtless developed by the Greeks themselves, while
some had come to them from the East. They have in
general the ear-marks of great antiquity, and belong to
the childhood of the world. In their primitive simplicity
people explained the chance resemblance ol a mass of
rock to a man's or woman’s figure by assuming that it
was actually a man or a woman transformed into stone.
In the same way similarity or fancied similarity in bird
or beast to human qualities led them to suppose that these
really were men and women who had been changed into
animals. The gum exuding from the bark of a tree
suggested tears, and it was an easy transition from this
idea to that of some person transformed at a time of
sorrow and weeping into a tree. At the root ol all such
notions is probably the firmly lixed belief in the immor-

in one shape or another continuations of the former life.

But the metamorphosis is only the climax ol the
story. of the substance, of the contents of the iables,
the origins are as diverse as the myths themselves. In
some cases*reasonably simple explanations have been
suggested. For example, Proserpina, according to the
