TRISTIA

The collection ol poems known under this name con· Ι
sists of five books, the first ol which was written by Ovid
during his journey lrom Rome to Tomi, his place of
exile on the Black Sea, while the other four were com-
posed alter he had reached his destination. All were
sent to Rome, and apart lrom the consolation that the
writer found in the exercise of his poetical faculty,
their aim was to promote sympathy lor the hardness
oi his lot, and so increase the possibility of pardon
and recall. The poems show a very narrow range
oi subject, continually coming back to the same themes,
namely, the hardships of the journey out,¹ the bleak
nature ol the region in which Tomi was situated, the
rigor oi the winter, and the uncivilized character oi
the inhabitants. To his complaints on these topics are
added appeals lor pardon, or at'least a different place
oi exile.
