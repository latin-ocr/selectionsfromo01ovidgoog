96 SELECTIONS FROM OVID

MIDAS

(Met. xi, 85-145)

[When some Phrygian mstics found old Silenus, the
companion of Bacchus, wandering about the fields, they
took him before King Midas. He, recognizing him,
treated him kindly, and restored him to Bacchus. In his
gratitude the wine-god promised to grant the king any
boon he should ask. Thereupon Midas prayed that he
might be given the power of converting anything that
he touched into gold. Bacchus assented, and Midas,
hardly able to believe in his good fortune, saw branches,
stoneS, and clods of earth turn to gold at his touch. So
it was with a mind full of dreams of vast wealth and
boundless power that he sat down to dinner. His joy
speedily became grief, for to his horror he saw bread
and wine likewise tum to gold when he touched them.
With starvation staring him in the face, he implored

Bacchus to save him from the doom that his greed had
brought upon him. And Bacchus, pitying him, bade
him go to the source of the river Pactolus and bathe in
its waters. He did s0, and the fatal power left him,
passing into the river, which from that day rolled down
sands of gold]
