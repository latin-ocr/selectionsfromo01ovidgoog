These names guarantee the highest standard oi scholarship and
pedagogio fitness.

The whole series throughout is based on the lines laid 'down in the
Report oi the Committee oi Twelve ot the American Philological Anao·
clation to the National Educational Association.

These lines are now universally accepted as defining the ideal clas·
sical course for recondary schools. The Twentieth Century Classical
Texta satisiy at every point this universal requirement.

The methods oi teaching Latin and Greek as revised and now
adopted by American educators call ior a less pedantic‚ more human-
istic style, dom-inantly literary in spirit, giving a clear, iorceful impres·
sion oi ancient lise and thought. The modern secondary text-book ia
not merely grammatical, but also historical; fitted to arouse living
enthusiasm for the great masterpieces oi ancient thought and ior their
exquisite literary dress.

All this, recently iocused in the action oi the National Educational
Associatiom is now embodied ior the first time in this Series, edited by
representative scholars oi the universitiea that have had nroat to do
with classical culture in America.

The general editors and their collengues are all practical teachers¹
originators, and leaders in the courses now pursued in pur recondary·
school system.

Hence, the Twentteth century clamtoal Series ollem tha
simplest, most penetrent, and upon-decet Latin and (lraelr
, books ever prepared lor Amerlonnvachodla.
