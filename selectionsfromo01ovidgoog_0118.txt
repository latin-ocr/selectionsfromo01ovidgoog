60 SELECTIONS FROM OVID

close to the regions ol Tartarus, she had seen Proserpina
as the wife of Pluto.

Then Ceres, having determined accurately the where-
abouts of her daughter, appealed to Jupiter lor redress
He listened kindly to her, and while pointing out that
Proserpina's position was one of great honor, promised
Ceres that her daughter should be reclaimed, provided,
however, she had not tasted food in the world below.
But it turned out that Proserpina had eaten pomegran-
ate seeds there, and so Jupiter did not see his way to
carrying out Ceres' wish. When, however, the goddess
still continued to importune him, he effectcd a compro-
mise between her and Plut0, by which it was agreed that
Proserpina should spend six months of each year in the
lower world with her husband, and six in the world
above with Ceres]

Prima Ceres unco glaebam dimovit aratr0,
prima dedit fruges alimentaque mitia terriS,
prima dedit leges: Cereris sunt omnia munus,
Illa canenda mihi est. Utinam modo dicere possem
carmina digna dea: certe dea carmine digna est. ¹ aas
Vasta giganteis ingesta est insula membris
Trinacris, et magnis subiectum molibus urget
aetherias ausum sperare Typhoea sedes.
Nititur ille quidem pugnatque resurgere saepe,
dextra sed Ausonio manus est subiecta Peloro, aso
laeva, Pachyne, tibi, Lilybaeo crura premuntur,
degravat Aetna caput: sub qua resupinus harenas .
eiectat flammamque ferox vomit ore Typhoeus.

’ Saepe remoliri luctatur pondera terrae,

oppidaque et magnos devolvere corpore montes. ³⁵5
