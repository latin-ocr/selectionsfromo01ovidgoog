xxiv INTRODUCTION

most part the qualities mentioned are to be found, under a ¹

higher or lower concentration, in the literary productions
oi the age. There never had been before in any period of
Latin literature, and there never were again, among so con-
siderable a body of men such high ideals of artistic composi-
tion, such metrical dexterity, and such precision of lan-
guage. It was the literature of an age when culture had
reached a high level. Both poets and prose writers were
familiar with Greek literature, and had before them, as
models or as wamings, everything that had been done in
the particular province of literary endeavor to which they
were devoting themselves. They had studied literary types,
had in some cases even formulated rules of composition,
and they worked with a definite understanding of what
was from the point of view of the higher criticism of the
day, permissible in any given kind of literary work.

But while the writers of the Augustan age attained to
a very unusual degree of formal excellence, they had the
faults of their virtues. They showed a proueness to arti-

upon substance, to place artistic execution before spon·
taueity oi expression, to prefer brilliancy and polish to
creative power. And so with all his subtle charm we do
not get from Virgil that impression of sincerity which the
Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer give us, which the De
Rerum Natura of Lucretius gives us, nor do we find in
Horace anything that resembles the passionate intensity of
Sapph0, or the sweetness of tone that makes Catullus's

lyrics the best in the Latin language. To Virgil and Hor-
ace the work of Lucretius and Catullus seemed rough and
crude. So far as technique is concemed there are good
grounds lor this opinion. The suff, somewhat monotonous
hexameters of Lucretius do not compare with *Virgil’s flex-
ible and melodious lines; and the metrical experiments of
