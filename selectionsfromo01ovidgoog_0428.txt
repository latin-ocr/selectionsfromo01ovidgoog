TWENTIETH OENTURY TEXT-BOOKS.

Eight Orations os Cicero, together with
Selected Passages and Letters

Edited, with an Introduction, Notes, and a Vocah
ulary, by CHARLES H. FORBES, A.M., Professor ol
Latin in Phillips Academy‚ Andover, Mass. 12mo.

Cloth, 8140.

The textos the first six orations in this book is that of
C. 1². W. Mttller‚ now commonly used in the best school·
books abroad. For the Pro Milone and the Pro Marcello
the superior readings ot A. C. Clark, in the Oxsord series,

have been adopted. The Sanncrnn Passaors for extra ’

reading were chosen for their worth and beauty, and these,
together with the few short Lsrrans will afford a glimpse
ot the orator in other fields oi literature. But the student's
strength should be given to the understanding oi Cicero as
an orator—a taslr quite difficult enough sor a year's study.
The Nonas are designed for students, and havebeen tested
in actual use. No ellort has been made to wrest grammat·
ical drill from the hands ol the teacher, nor to deprive hirn
of ample leeway for the illustration and elucidation of the
subject-matter. The translations suggested aim to lead the
pupi] into the paths of respectable English, and to prevent
the disastrous persistence of crude impressions‚ received
, ¹while his mind was groping for ideas in a wilderness oi
unfamiliar words. The student will find quite enough ma-
terial left for the exercise of his own powers.
