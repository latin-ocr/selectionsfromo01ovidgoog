THE AUGUSTAN AGE xxv

Catullus are far inferior to the many examples ol technical
dexterity that are furnished by the odes of Horace. But

in the single poem which we have from Lucretius's hand
and in the lyrics of Catullus we have a sincerity of expres-
sion and an intensity of feeling which can not be paralleled
in the whole range oi Augustan literature.

Of this tendency to artificiality one ol the principal causes
was the influence ol the writers ol Alexandria. This city
had been the center of Greek culture from the third century
a. c. A great library had been founded there by Ptolemy
Soter, and he and his successors did everything in their
power to stimulate literature. They were along certain lines
eminently successful, but the work produced, especially in
poetry, was in a marked degree artificial. The Alexandrians
were scholars of wide reading, of even unusual erudition,
but it is exceptional to find in their productions any note ol
true poetic'inspiration. In its place are recondite mytho-
logical allusions, verbal conceits, and epigrammatic bril-
liancy. The poets were highly trained literary craltsmen
rather than inspired bards, many ol them priding themselves
on the ease with which they could turn from one kind of
composition to another: from epic poetry to lyric‚ from lyric

Δ to didactic. The influence of this school upon Roman

literature was very great. It had made itseli felt in the
poetry of the republic just as it did now in that ol the
empire, although in both periods there were men who kept
themselves free from it. Among the Augustans, for ex-
ample, Horace made the earlier Greek poets his models;
Tibullus too had but little sympathy with the studied
elaborateness of most of the work ol the school. But in
Propertius, Ovid, and the younger poets generally, Alex·
andrian influence is strongly marked.
