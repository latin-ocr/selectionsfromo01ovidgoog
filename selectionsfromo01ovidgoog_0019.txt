LIFE AND WORKS OF OVID xiii

gies oi a different type. One of these deals with the death
oi the poet Tibullus, and shows us the best side oi Ovid’s
character; another contains a description oi a festival in
honoros Jun0. ln the former we have an example oi the
elegy of mourning, a type well developed in Greek litera·
ture as early as the fifth century a. c.; in the latter a iore-

in the Fasti.

The Amores, written when Ovid was in the early twen-
ties, were originally published in five books. The second
edition, the one which has come down to us, consists oi
three books. ln the period between these two publicatione
another poem appeared, the Heroides, a collection oi im-
aginary letters by well-known heroines of mythology to
absent or faithless lovers. It waS, as we have seen, to
love-affairs that Ovid had turned first and, insomuch as
the Corinna elegies dealt with an affair in which many
of the episodes were unquestionably imaginary, transition
to the amatory entanglements of legendary heroines was
not difficult. The idea of the imaginary letter asa literary
form Ovid claims as his own, and so lar as Roman litera-
ture is concerned the claim has some foundation. ln
Propertius we do indeed find the letter of Arethusa to her
husband, but this differs materially from the Heroides, inso
much as both writer and recipient were real persons. In
Greek literature, however, the imaginary letter was a famil-
iar device, there being many examples in Alexandrian
writers. For his material Ovid drew on various sources:
Homer, the Greek dramatists, especially Euripides, the

Alexandriam, aud, among Roman poets, Catullus and
Virgil. ’

His next work belongs, so far as its context is con· χ

but its general character differs greatly irom that oi any
