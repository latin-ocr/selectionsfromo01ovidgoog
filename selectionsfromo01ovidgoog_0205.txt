In this passage the poet celebrates the various lunc-

Una dies media est, et fiunt sacra Minervae,
nominaque a iunctis quinque diebus habent. 810
Sanguine prirna vacat, nec fas concurrere lerr0. ¹
Causa, quod est illa nata Minerva die.
Altera tresque super rasa celebrantur harena.
Ensibus exsertis bellica laeta dea est.
Pallada nunc pueri teneraeque orate puellae: 815
qui bene placarit Pallada, doctus erit.
Pallade placata lanam mollire puellae
discant et plenas exonerare colos.
Illa etiarn stantis radio percurrere telas
erudit et rarum pectine denset opus. 820
Hanc cole, qui maculas laesis de vestibus aufers:
hanc cole, velleribus quisquis aena paras
Nec quisquam invita faciet bene vincula plantae
Pallade, sit Tychio doctior ille licet.
