VI
PROSODY

It is assumed that the student, from his reading of Latin
prose, is reasonably familiar not only with the quantities
of the vowels in the words that he hasmet, but also with.
the rules which control the quantities of syllables. For
since the rhythm of a Latin verse depends primarily upon
the quantities of the syllables of which it consists, a knowl-
edge of these is the first essential to an intelligent reading
of Latin poetry. An adequate treatment of the subject
may be found in any grammar, but for the sake of con·
venience a few cardinal principles are set down here:

(1) A syllable that contains a long vowel or a diph-
thong is long by nature.

(2) A syllable in which a vowel is followed by two or
more consonants or by a double consonant (xa) is long
by position; unless 'the consonantal combination consists of
a mute and a liquid (l r), in which case the syllable is sorne-
times long and sometimes short.

(3) Α syllable in which a short vowel is followed by
another vowel or by a single consonant is short by nature.

For the quantities of vowels and of syllables see W.
Μ» 6824951 AG. 18, 347-354; GL. 12-14‚ 702·713;
H. 14, 15. 687 ff.; B. 5, 362 ff.; ΗΒ. Ιίν3ο.

Syllables are combined in metrica} units called feet. Of
these there are many different kinds. Some of the more
important are the dactyl (wo). the spondee (- -), and
the trochee (- ol. In all of these the ictus, i. e.‚ the
rhythmico! beot, falls upon the first syllable. ln the case
of any foot. the syllable that has the ictus is lniown as the

thesis; the part without ictus is called the arsis
