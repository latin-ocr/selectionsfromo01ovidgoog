ROMAN RELIGION xxxvii

of these early Roman gods: they were not conceived of
as having the shapes and characteristics ot men. They
were regarded as spirits who dwelt in the various objects,
places, and activities to which they belonged. Jupiter per-
vaded the air; Janus the door; Vesta the hearth. And so
it was not till nearly two centuries alter the founding ol
the city that the Romans had temples or imagcs of their
gods

But with the extension of Rome's power changes were
made in her religion. The gods of conquered Italian com-
munities were introduced, and a movement that began
toward the end ol the regal period led to the Hellenization
ol almost all the Roman cults. Roman gods were identi-
fied with the Greek deities whose spheres ot action were
held to be the same: Jupiter was identified with Zeus;
Juno with Hera; Minerva with Pallas Athene ; Ceres with
Demeter3 Liber with Dionysus3 Neptunus with Poseid0n;
Mars with Ares; Vulcanus with Hephaestus; Diana with
Artemis; Venus with AphrodIte; Tellus with Gaea; Vesta
with Hestia. The worship of the Greek god Apollo was
introduced under his own name at an early date. Another
early importation from Greece was the cult of Hermes who
bore on Latin soil the name ol Mercurius.

This Helleuization of the old Roman beliefs had be-
come an established lact long before Ovid's time. It mani-
fested itself not simply in the identification of Roman with
Greek gods, but also in the introduction of Greek forms ol
worship, and in the transfer to Roman gods ol all those
myths which had grown up around the Greek divinities.
So what we find in the greater part of the Metamorphoses
'is really Greek mythology under Roman names,
