Ovid uses only two meters: the Dactylic Hexameter
and the Dactylic Pentameter.

The Dactylic Hexarneter is a verse consisting oi six
feet (ἕξ μέτρα). Of these the first four are either dactyls
ΙΔ υυ), or their metrical equivalents, spondees (ι -); the

fifth ioot is regularly a dactyl‚ but occasionally a· spondee ; ¹

the sixth foot is either a spondee or a trochee (ι ν). When
there is a spondee in the fifth font, the verse is called
spondaic. Poets nse spondaic lines when, in order to give
a better representation ol the action or state described, they
want a verse with a specially slow movement. For a
spondee, consisting as it does of two long syllables, is slower
than a dactyl with its one long and two shorts. To a large
extent this consideration determines also the proportion ot'
dactyls and spondees in the first four feet of the verse.

The principal caesura generally occurs after the thesis
or in the arsis of the third foot. Not infrequently, however,
it is found in the fourth loot, in which case there is generally
a subordinate caesura in the second font.

The scheme oi the dactylic hexameter is as follows:

--υυΙ--υνΙ--υψΙ··κΛιΙ-ΙυυΙΙ-ἱΕ
