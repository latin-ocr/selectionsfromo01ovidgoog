In the introduction to this volume the editor presents
the character ot Caesar to the student not merely as the
conqueror os Gaul and the author ol the Commentaries,
but as a real human being-one of the most powersul
factors in the history of the world. Two editions have been
issued: one containing the whole os the seven books, the
other the first four books only, omitting text and notes of
Books V, VI, and VII, leaving the introduction and
vocabulary the same. The vocabulary is briei and com-
pact, without such scientific and philological matter as
would be beyond the grasp of the average high-school
pupil. The text is fully and appropriately illustrated, not·
ably in regard to ’ the account ol Caesar’s army, its organi-
zation, tactics, military engiueering, etc. The notes to
Books I and II are unusually sull aud comprehensive, con-

taining many grammar references3 the notes to the last ,

books are brieter, directed mainly to following the narrative
and allowing more rapid reading of the text. A bibliog-
raphy is given, suggesting the best books for the teacher’s
collateral reading or study.
