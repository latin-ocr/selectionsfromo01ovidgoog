xlii INTRODUCTION

Example of spondaic verse:
Ldmlni virsiln'tnt Η dnllmim slmdl Ι ἐκΙιῑιΙΙᾶῐῖιηῐ.
Met. VI, 247·

This measure has sometimes been used by English poets,
and the following lines taken from Kingsley’s Andromeda
will perhaps help the student to understand the movement
of the ancient verse. It will be noticed, however, that in
these lines the rhythm depends not upon the quantities of
the syllables as in Latin hexameterS, but on the accents of
the words.
So through the long, long hours the maid stood helpless and hopeless,
Wide·eyed, downward gazing in vain at the black, blank darkness.

Feebly at last she began, while wild thoughts bubbled within her:
'⁴ Guiltless Ι am; why thus then? Are gods more ruthless than mortals?

¹ , Have they no merny for youth? No love for the souls who have loved them?

Even as 110ved thee, dread sea, as I played by thy margin,
Blessing thy wave as it cooled me, thy wind as it breathed on my forehead.”

The so-called Dactylie Pentameter is really only a
modification of the hexameter. Instead of a dactyl or
spondee in the third foot it has one aecented long syllable
followed by diaeresis, and instead of a spondee or a trochee
in the sixth foot one aecented syllable either long or short.
Spondees may be substituted for dactyls in the first two ·
feet only.

The scheme is as follows:

Sed tamen Ι ὴῖἑ licrllmac‘: ll ponderi l vocis hilbent.
Ileroid. III, 4.

Fris est l de ddmllno ll pauet vflroque quiid-lb„ 6.

The dactylic pentameter is used only in connection with
the dactylic hexameter, completing the sense of the latter,
and forming with it the Elegiae stanza. It is this stanza
. that is used in all the important poems of Ovid, with the
exception of the Metamorphoses. The name pentameter
