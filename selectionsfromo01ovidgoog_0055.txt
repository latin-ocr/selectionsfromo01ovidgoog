THE METAMORPHOSES 5

prominent place is given to the myths that cluster
around the foundation and early history of Thebes, to
the Argonautic expedition, the Trojan war, the com·
ing of Aeneas to Latium, the founding of Rome, and
the death of Julius Caesar, with whose metamorphosis
into a star the poem ends. How far the order of the
stories is of the poet’s own devising, or to what extent
he followed the arrangement that he found in other col-
lections, is uncertain. While something is undoubtedly
due to his predecessors‚ it is generally assumed that the
connection of the stories is for the mostpart Ovid’s
own. It shows a wonderful ingenuity, a singularly dex·
terous manipulation of material. The relative chrono-
logical position of the more important cycles of stories
(as, for example, those that were connected with the
voyage of the Argonauts and with the Trojan war)
occasioned no difficulty. It was in weaving the host of
other fables into the sequence that the poet's real task
lay. For it must be remembered that, while within the
different cycles stories sometimes have an internal con-
nection, there is no connection of this kind between the
cycleS, and there are in addition many single stories that
stand quite alone, without affiliation with any of the
others Ovid adopts various devices of juncture. For
example, when there are different versions of the
same myth, he chooses that one which affords the easiest
transition to the story which he intends to give next.
Another method he uses is that of putting a number of
fables into the mouth of some person whom he has
introduced in the regular course of his narrative. An
illustration of this is found in the stories told to one

another by the daughters of Minyas as they sit spinning
