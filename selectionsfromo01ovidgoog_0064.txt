APOLLO Avo DAPHNE ’
‹Met- ruz-⁵⁶7>

[“ Little hast thou to do with arm3,'’ said Apollo to
Cupid when he saw him hending his b0w; “they are be-
coming to me, but hardly to thee. Content thyself with
thy love-affairs.” ‘⁴ Great indeed is the power of thy
bow,'’ was the answer, “ but thou thysell shalt be subdued
by mine.’'

Not long afterward the angry little god fulfilled his
threat. He drew two arrows from his quiver, one
gilded and making lor love,‘the other tipped with lead
and inspiring hatred of love. With the first he pierced
Apollo’s heart, with the other wounded the nymph
Daphne, daughter of the river-god Peneus. And so it
came about that Apollo felt for the first time the power ¹
of love, but Daphne shranh from it. Many suitors came
to her, hut she repulsed them all, living in freedom in the
woodS, and in her hatred of men rivalling the virgin god-
dess Diana. And most of all did she· fiee from Apollo.
“ No ordinary lover am I,’' he cried, “ but the lord of the

Delphic land, of Tenedos, and of Patara, a son oi Jove
himself, with knowledge of all things that are, or have .
been, or shall be; the god ol heading, too, able to cure
every ill that flesh is heir to, everything except, alas!
