THE METAMORPHOSES 87

THE SONG OF ORPHEUS
(Mlt- x, 143ll.)

[It was only in song and in the music of his lyre that
Orpheus found any solace after the loss of Eurydice;
but such was the magic power of his strains that even
trees and wild animals crowded around him to listen.

Among other themes he sang of Ganymedes, son of
Tros, king of Troy. The boy, beloved of Jove on account
of his beauty, was carried up to heaven hythe god himself,
who had assumed the shape of his own eagle. In heaven
he served as Jove’s cup-bearer (x, 148-161).

He sang, t00, of the death of Hyacinthus, the favor-
ite of Apollo. Hyacinthus and the god were vying with
one another in throwing the discus, Apollo had thrown it,
and Hyacinthus ran forward to mark the spot where it
was going to fall. But the discus, rebounding violently
from the ground, struck him in the face and killed him.
Sorrowing deeply, Apollo caused a new flower, named
for him, to spring from his blood (X, 162-219).

Another part of Orpheus’ song dealt with the story
of Atalanta, which in Ovid’s poem is supposed to be told
by Venus to Adonis (X, 56o680).

Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus, a Boeotian king,
famous for her bcauty and her fieetness of foot, had
¹ been wamed against marriage by an oracle which she
had consulted. It was accordingly with full confidence
in her speed that she announced to her suitors that she
would marry that one who should defeat her in a foot-
race. If, however, any one tried and failed, he was to

forfeit his lif .
