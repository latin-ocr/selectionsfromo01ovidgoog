LIFE AND WORKS OF OVID xv

the national lile at many points, and it was to Roman
patriotism that Ovid in writing the poem intended to appeal.

. Technically the work belongs to the type known as the

etiological elegy, that is, one that concerns itsell with ori-
gins and causes. The type was not, ol course, originated
by Ovid. lt had been a familiar literary form with the
Alexandrian Greeks, and even in Roman literature Ovid
had a precursor in Propertius a number oi whose elegies
are devoted to the origins ol national festivals.

The Metamorphoses and the first six books of the Fasti
were finished when the great disaster ol Ovid’s lite oc-
curred. He was banished by the Emperor Augustus to
Tomi, a bleak and desolate place on the western shores of
the Black Sea. This happened in 8 no, when he was
fifty years of age. He had long been recognized as tlre
most gifted ol living poets, and his position in the exclusive
literary and social circles of the city was one oi unusual
prominence. To no one could such an exile have been a
greater blow. His interests were centered in Rome. The
atmosphere oli the capitalt with its literary gathe'rings‚ its
social gaiety, tsme tropolit an pomp, and its political pres·
nge, had come to be absolutely essentialt to his happiness,
and, it may be added, to his poetical efficiency. What the
cause oi his exile was is not wholly certain. It seems proba-
ble, however, that he was in some way connected with an
intrigue ol Julia, the granddaughter ol the emperor; and
that this lact caused the emperor, already ill-disposed
toward him on account ol the doubtlul morality oi some ol
his earlier writings‚ to banish him.

Ol his leelings when announcement of the decree ol exile

was made to him, ol the hardships ol the Journey to Tomi, .
and oi his sufferings there we find abundant expression in the
Tristia and in the Epistulae ex Ponto, the two works which
constitute the most important part ol the literary output
