THE METAMORPHOSES

It is not the workaday world that we find in the
Metamorphoses of Ovid, but a world oi wonders‚ of
supernatural influenceS, of mystery, magic, and enchant-
ment. Gods and goddesses, nymphs and fauns, demi-
gods and heroes, giants of vast size and strange attri-
butes fire-spitting dragonS, and monstrous creatures of
the deep are seen side by side with men and women in
the changing scenes of this mythical phantasmagoria.
There is no sharp line oi division between the human
‘and the divine, the natural and the supernatural. The
divinities love and hate, show anger and jealousy, ambi-
tions and strivings have their bickerings and reconcilia-
tions just as the mortals in whose affairs they take so
lively an interest, and whose fortunes they are so ready
to advance or to thwart. Nor are the actions oi the men
and women of this wonder-world bounded by normal
hnrnan limitations. Guardian deities are ever by their
sides, giving strength to their arms, craft to their minds‚
courage to their hearts; and at such times the proof oi
their prowess is not to be found in the victory, to which
divine assistance contribntes so much, bnt in the fact
of their having, without assurance oi supernatural aid,
submitted themselves to tests which no mortal, even
. though he were the bravest oi the brave, could of his

own power withstand.
