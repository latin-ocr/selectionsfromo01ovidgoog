PROSODY xliii

arose from the old and erroneous division of the line into
five leet.

English poets have experimented with this meter also.
The following example is taken from Clough's Amours
de V apage:

Is it illusion? Or does there a spirit {rom perlecter ages,
Here, even yet, amid loss, change, and corruption abide?

Lives in the exquisite grace os the column disjoinled and single,
Haunls the rude messes os brick garlanded gaily with vine,

E'en in the turret fantastic surviving that springs {rom the min,
E'en in the people itselsl Is it illusion orno?
