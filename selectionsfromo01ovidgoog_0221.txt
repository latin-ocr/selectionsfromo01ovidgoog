according to the Greek poet Hesiod, the Cyclops were three in number:
Brontes (βροντή, thunder), Steropes ’(περοτή, lightning), and Arges (lep-fir,
rapid). They were giants, sons oi Uranus and Gaea (Heaven and Earth),
and they are'represented as forging thunderbolts ior Zeus (Jupiter). In
Homer's Odyssey they are described as giants, but led a pastoral lile
somewhere in the West. Later accounts coniuse the two versions, follow-
ing Hesiod in representing them as making the thunderbolts oi Jupiter,
but seeming to follow Homer in placing them on Sicily or some ot the
neighboring islanda. As we see irom the names given to them by Hesiod,
they were nothing more than personifications ot forces oi nature.
