. The story of the struggles and adventures of the mythi-
cal AEneas will always be of fascinatiug interest to young
students and readers. In his book Professor Carter presents
· the work of the great Latin poet to school-boys as literature
rather than as a clothes-horse for syntactical theories. The

' editor has endeavored to make the reading of the AEneid ¹ ὁ

interesting, and this he has succeeded in doing. His vivid
picture of Virgil's personality makes him appear as a living,
active contemporary rather than as a dim vision of the
past, aud the student is eager to read the story as it came
from Virgil’s peu. In the Notes the poetical beauty of
the narrative is brought out, and the customs‚ places, and
characters referred to are explained. Quantities have been

marked iu the Vocabulary only, the editor believing that ¹ .

the rnarkiug of quantities in recent text-books has been
carried too far. The text followed has been mainly that of

Ribbeck's, but conjectures have been admitted where it ι

has seemed wise. The illustrations in the book are uumer-
ous and attractive, and a number of maps and charts in3
crease the graphic element in the elucidatiou of the text. .
