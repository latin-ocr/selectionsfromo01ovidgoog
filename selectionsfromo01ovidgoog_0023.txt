CHARACTERISTICS OF OVID'S POETRY xvii

of fantastic and humorous expansion, of subtle interpre-
¹tation and suggestion, ol innuendo, of the art that tells
more in proportion as it seems to repress. He fairly revels

in the mass of material that lay to hand in the gay society
ol the capital in which he was himself no inconspicuous
figure; and he delights. in the pseudodidactic tone with
which he tells the young Romans what they must do if they
would succeed in love.

In the Heroides we see many of the same qualities which
we have noticed in the Antores and the Ars Amatoria, lor
here, t00‚ are ingenious turns ol thought, play ol fancy,
and marvelous fluency. But other qualities were requisite.

⁸ ¹ ln his previous poems he had described, interpreted, in-

structed; in the Heroides he was confronted with the prob·
lem of giving expression to the moods ol women when
neglected or deserted: he had to portray character. He
succeeded. Taking into consideration the number ol the
heroines and the strong points ol similarity in the situa-
tions in which they found themselves, their characters have
been effectively differentiated. Penelope is the true and
loyal wile waiting patiently for her husband's return;
Oenone is the jealous country girl; Medea is the fierce
Oriental who does not forget that she has been wronged;
and so throughout the whole gallery we find in each por-
trait a different manifestation of mood. But while the poet
has been successful in giving us a series of individual char-
acters, there is not in the portrayal ol any ol them that
profound understanding of human nature which is the
ground soil from which great masterpieces of characteriza-
tion spring. Ovid had insight into character, as his other
poems show abundantly; but his insight was not prolound
enough to penetrate to the depths ol human passion. He
understood well all the ramifications, all the motives oi

the petty love-intrigues that he saw around him in Roman
