endeavored to point out those poetical qualities which
have given Ovid his place in literature. ln regard to

syntaX, I have assumed in my readers a working knowl- ’

edge of fundamental principles; but to meet the possi-
bility of there being gaps in the grammatical erudition
even ol those who have read several books of Caesar I
have inserted references to the grammars most frequently
used in the schools.

I have consulted from time to time most of the for-
s eign and American editions of Ovid‚ especially those of ¹
Magnus, Haupt (Metamorphoses), Palmer (Heroides),
Allen and Greenough, Kelsey, Miller, and Anderson
(Selectr'orrs). The text oi the Metamorphoses is based
on the edition ol Magnus that of the other selections on
Riese’s edition. I have, however, departed from their
Ἴ readings ina number of passages.

I am especially indebted to my wife for material
assistance in the compilation ol the Vocabulary, to Pro-
fessor Andrew Fleming West for many valuable sug-
gestions, and to my publisherS, Messrs. D. Appieton&

Company‚ for their unlailing courtesy.
