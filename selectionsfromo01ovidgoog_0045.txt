⁸ A succession of feet, arranged according to a more or
less definitely fixed principle, forms a verse.

When a word ends within a foot there results what is
called a caestira (cutting). In one verse there may be
two or even more caesuras. If one of these breaks coin-
cides witha pause in the sense, it constitutes the principal
caesura of the verse. When a caesura occurs after the
thesis it is called a masculine caesura; when it occurs in
the arsis, it is known as a feminine caesura. These terms
have arisen from the more vigorous character of the verse
with caesura after the thesis, In metrical schemes the
caesura is marked ΙΙ.

When the end of a word and the end of a foot coin-
cide, the pause is called diaeresis (dividing). This is
marked ll.

The following phenomena, of frequent occurrence in
Latin poetry, should also be noticed:

(1) Elisium—This is the slurring over of a final vowel,
diphthong, or syllable in m before an initial vowel or h.
The final vowel or syllable should not be entirely sup-
pressed, as it usually is, but merely pronounced lightly.

Example:

Quodque culpit, spelm, ΙΙ ειιεΙφιθἽΙῙῑῑῆΙηοιιΙα Ι fallunt.
Met. I, 491.

When a final vowel occurs before osor est, the initial e
is completely lost—i. e, bono es is pronounced bonae, bono
est is pronounced bonust. When a final syllable in m occurs
before es or est, both final m and initial e are lost—i. e,
bonnm est is pronounced bonust.

Examples :

Coniugis l augurilo Η quamlquam Tiltania 1 mota (elst.
Met. J, 395.

Quod solildu(m e)st flecltique nelquit, 11 multatur in Ι ossa.
Met. Ι, 409.
