et liquet esse deam, duc, o duc' inquit ‘et offer
coniugis ora mihi. Quae si modo posse videre
fata semel dederint, caelum accepisse videbor.’

Nec mora, Romuleos cum virgine Thaumantea 845
ingreditur colles. Ibi sidus ab aethere lapsum
decidit in terraS, a cuius lumine flagrans
Hersilia aerias cum sidere cessit in auras.
Hanc manibus notis Romanae conditor urbis
excipit et priscum pariter cum corpore nomen 85⁰
mutat Horamque vocat, quae nunc dea iuncta Quirino

est.

[Great as had been the career of Julius Caesar in war
and in administration, it was this alone that won for
him admittance to the ranks of the gods For, as im-
portant, il not more important, than any ol his achieve-
ments was the lact that Augustus called him father.

When Venus saw the conspirators planning the assas-
sination of Caesar, she urged the gods to interfere, but
they, although touched by her appeals could not change
the decrees of late. They were, however, able to warn
men ol the impending calamity by many a direful omen:
the clash ol arms was heard in the skies; the lace ol the ’
sun was darkened; meteors blazed across the heavens;
showers of blood fell upon the land; the ill-boding owl
hooted her dismal warnings; in a thousand places statues
ol ivory were seen to weep ; the entrails of victims offered
in sacrifice showed no lavorable sign; and ghosts walked
through the lrightened city.
