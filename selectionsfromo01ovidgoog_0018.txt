xii INTRODUCTION

Propertius, Ponticus, Macer, and Bassus, and it was not
long before he was regarded as the most brilliant member
oi the younger literary eircle at Rome.

He first became known to the general public through
the Amores, a collection oi elegiae poems, the central figure
oi whiehis one Corinna, with whom Ovid represents him-
self as being deeply in love. Who Corinna was, or whether
she was a real person or not, has never been finally deter-
mined, but there is strong reason ior supposing that her
personality was fictitious. The various moods of lovers
were familiar themes oi elegiae poets. In the ease of some
of the poets it was a definite person who inspired their
verses. For example, Delia, who appears so prominently Δ
in the poetry ol Tibullus, has been identified as Plania,
a Roman lady of the times. The identity ot Propertius’s
Cynthia has likewise been fixed. But in the absence ol
a real love-affair it was legitimate lor an elegiae poet to
evolve from his own imagination some one whose person-
ality, even though it were but a figment oi his fancy, ’
would give a semblanee of unity toa series of love poems.
The supposition that Corinna belongs to this imaginary
elass is strengthened by the fact that the Romans at the
time of the publication of the poems were as much puzzled
to know who she was as subsequent ages have been.

The greater part oi the Amores deal with various love-
situations. We are told of the poet’s struggle with Cupid,
ol his final submission; of his supreme happiness when he
was with Corinna, his misery when he was ioreed to be
away from her; oi the anxiety with which he awaited her
answer to a note whieh he had sent by her maid Nape, and
his distress when the maid returned with an unlavorable ι
reply. ln one elegy he expresses his determination to break
with her; in another we find him reconciled and more ardent
. than ever. Here and there among the love-poems are ele·
