TRISTIA

ianua, sed-nullo tempore aperta fuit!
Cur ego tot gladios lugi, totiensque minata
obruit infelix nulla procella caput?
Di, quos experior nimium constanter iniquos
- participes irae quos deus unus habet,
*exstimulata precor, cessantia lata meique
interitus clausas esse vetate fores!

TO A FAITHFUL FRIEND
(Tre'st. lii, 5)

[You and Ι had never been intimate, and it would
have been easy for you when Ι was disgraced to pretend
that yon did not know me. It was in this way that
most of my friends acted. But you, even at your own
peril, cameto me, and Ι could see that your sympathy

was genuine. Do you wonder what Ι do in this place? I ’

live in hope that the emperor's wrath may pass away.
' Do what you can to help my cause and prove to me
that my hopes are not in vain. The greater the man,
the more easily is he appeased. An emperor may ac-
cordingly relent. Achilles yielded to the entreaties ol
Priam; Alexander showed magnanimity towards Porus
and Darius; and, not to exclude the gods, Juno accepted
as her son-in-law her old loe Hercules. Ι was not guilty
of any crime. Ι never plotted against Caesar, nor ut-
tered treasonahle words. I merely made a mistake, and
am being punished because Ι inadvertently saw something
which I should not have seen. Surely a different place of
exile, at least, might bc granted me]
