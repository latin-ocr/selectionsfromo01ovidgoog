THE METAMORPHOSES 111

in marriage, but in doing so broke iaith with Turnus,
king ol the Rutulians, a neighboring people. Thereupon,
TurnuS, calling the Etruscans to his aid, made war upon
the Trojans. Among other forms of violence he at-
tempted· on one occasion to burn the Trojan ships which
were mooted to the shore. He succceded in setting tire
to thern, and they were already ablaze when Cybele, the
mother oi the godS, upon whose sacred mountain the
timber used in their construction had grown, sent down
a heavy rain from heaven and extinguished the flames
At the same time one ol the windS, acting in coopera-
tion with her, broke the cables that tied thern to the
shore and drove thern out to sea, where Cybele, after
submerging them, changed them into sea-nymphs

Not even by this incident was Turnus deterred from
continuing the war, and it was only after his death that

Ardea, his capital, fell and the Trojan arms prevailed.
When the town was being burned, a heron, till that
time an unknown bird, flew up from the ashes, and to
it was given the name of the city from whose ruins it
rose]

Hinc ubi legati rediere, negata ferentes
arma Aetola sibi, Rutuli sine viribus illis
bella instructa gerunt. Multumque ab utraque cruoris
parte datur. Fert ecce' avidas in pinea Turnus ⁵3⁰
texta iaces; ignesque timent, quibus unda pepercit.
Iamque picem et ceras alimentaque cetera flammae
Mulciber urebat perque altum ad carbasa malum
ibat, et incurvae fumabant igne carinae:
cum memor has pinus Idaeo vertice caesas
sancta deum genetrix tinnitibus aera pulsi
