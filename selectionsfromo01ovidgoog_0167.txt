THE ·Ι)ΕΑΤΗ OF ACHILLES
(Met. nr, 58o619)

[Incensed with Achilles because he had killed his son
Cycnus, Neptune appealed to Apollo ior aid. Apollo
having been associated with Neptune in building the
walls ol Troy willingly took up his cause, and passed
swiltly to the plain of Troy. Standing beside Paris he
revealed his identity‚ and bade him instead of wasting
his arrows on ignoble Greeks to aim at Achilles who

was as usual carrying death and destruction into the
ranks of the Trojans. Paris obeyed. The arrow, guided

. by the god, pierced Achilles in a vulnerable spot, and
the great Greek lell dead upon the battle-field]

At deus, aequoreas qui cuspide temperat undas, 58⁰
in volucrem corpus nati Phaethontida versum
mente dolet patria, saevumque perosus Achillem
exercet memores plus quam civiliter iras.
Iamque fere tracto duo per quinquennia bello
talibus intonsum compellat Sminthea dictis:

‘O mihi de fratris longe gratissime natis,
inrita qui mecum posuisti moenia Troiae,
ecquid, ubi has iam iam casuras adspicis arces,
ingemis? Aut ecquid tot defendentia muros
milia caesa doles? Ecquid, ne persequar omnes,
Hectoris umbra subit circum sua Pergama tracti,
cum tamen ille ferox belloque cruentior ipso
vivit adhuc, operis nostri populator, Achilles?
Det mihi sel Fax0, triplici quid cuspide possim,
sentiat. At quoniam concurrere comminus hosti
non datur, occulta necopinum perde sagittal’
