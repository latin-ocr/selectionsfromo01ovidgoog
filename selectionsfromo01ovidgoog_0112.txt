Struck by her beauty and pitying her captivity he
alighted, and asked her who she was, and why she was

Neptune heard this, he sent a monster ol the deep
to lay waste the land, and the oracle of Ammon, on
being consulted, said that the country could be saved
only by sacrificing Andromeda. Much against his will,
her father, to save his subjects‚ had been compelled to ’
bind her to this rock.

She had not finished her narrative when a great com-

afterward the marriage was celebrated in the presence
of King Cepheus' court]
