mation has distinctiveness and individuality. It is this same
narrative power that gives charm and interest to many parts
of the Fasti. It is obvious that the calendar oi the year as
the subjectos a poem had vast possibilities ol dulness and
heaviness. Ovid has saved it by the stories introduced in
connection with the different festivals.

But il the poem on the Fasti furnishes an additional

prooi of Ovid’s faculty of narration, it brings out also one
oi his weaknesses. It betrays, just as we have noticed in
the case oi the characterizations oi the hemines, his inability
to go profoundly into a subject, to look into the very heart
oi a thing. The work, it will be remembered, purports to
deal with the origin ol festivals, but the results on this
side are disappointing. This aspect oi his theme called ior
graver qualities oi mind than Ovid possessed, and the treat-
mentis superficial.
. ln the Tomi group of poems there is a marked deteriora-
tion, although many oi them are ol great interest from the
autobiographical matter which they contain. Some, show-
ing the old fluency, the old verbal and metrical skill, even
rise to the level oi real poetry. But the dominant tone is
one oi long-drawn querulousness‚ and it can not be said
that as a whole they add materially to the glories oi Ovid’s
poetical achievement.

lesser degree, Tibullus and Propertius. Ol his relations
with these we gain some knowledge irom a passage in the
Tristia (iv, 10, 41 ff.): Virgil he had only seen, Horace
