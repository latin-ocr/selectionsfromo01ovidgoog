many skilful touches to his portrayals oi the heroines; b'ut
in the interpretation of feeling as proiound as that which
we must assume in many 'of the situations described, he
seems to stop short. There is almost a failure ol power.
Had his tragedy Medea, of which the ancient critics speak
so highly, come down to ue, our impression oi his faculty
