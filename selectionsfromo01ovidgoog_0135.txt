THE METAMORPllOSES 75

When they reached Colchis, on the eastern shore of
the Euxine, they found that King Aeetes would give up
the fleece only on the fulfilment of certain conditions:
that Jason should yoke two fise-breathing bulls, and with
them plow a strip of land known as the field of Mars;
then sow the ground with dragons' teeth‚ and overcome
the armed warriors who would spring from the ground
The venture seemed desperate, when chance, or the favor
ol the gods, gave Jason hope: Medea, the daughter oi
the king and famous lor her magical powerS, fell in
love with him. A long soliloquy (vv. 11-71) expresses
the divided state of her mind. On one side were her
patriotism and her loyalty to her father, on the other her
love lor Jason. The latter feeling finally triumphed.
She provided Jason with an ointment which, when rubbed
on his face, would enable him to bear the fiery breath
of the bulis, and instructed him, when the warriors
sprang up, to throw a stone among them, which would
cause them to destroy one another.

The day for the trial came, and the Colchians assem-
bled to witness it. ln =the middle of the multitude sat
Aeetes, and with him Medea. The result proved the
efficacy of Medea’s arts: Jason harnessed the fite-breath-
ing bulls plowed the land assigned, and when the war-
riors arose, diverted their fury upon themselves, and
they perished in mutual slaughter. Thcn lulling to
sleep by means ol a drug the dragon that watched the
fleece, he secured the prize, and taking Medea with him
returned to Thessaly]
