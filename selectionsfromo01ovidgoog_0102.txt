animal found on its way back to the woods and tore
to pieres Its jaws were still reeking with the blood
of an ox it had reeently killed, and in rending the
garment it left blood-stains on the fragments. Presently ¹
Pyramus came, and finding only Thisbe’s blood-stained
cloak, thought that she herself had perished. Thereupon
he stabbed himself under the mulberry-tree. Not long
afterward Thisbe ventured timidly back, but only arrived,
in time to see Pyramus expire. Then exclaiming that
she too was faithful unto death, killed herself.

When the parents found them they buried their ashes
in a single um, thatin death at least they might not
be divided; and the godS, in memory of the tragedy, de—
ereed that from that time on the fruit of the mulberry-
tree should be of a blood-red color]

' Pyramus et Thisbe, iuvenum pulcherrimus alter, ⁵⁵ Α
altera, quas Oriens habuit, praelata puellis,

contiguas tenuere domoS, ubi dicitur altam

coctilibus muris cinxisse Semiramis urbem. s
Notitiam primosque gradus vicinia feeit:

Conscius omnis abest: nutu signisque loquuntur,

quoque magis tegitur, tectus magis aestuat ignis.

Fissus erat tenui rima, quarn duxerat olim, ⁶⁵
cum fieret paries domui communis utrique.

Id vitium nulli per ¹saecula longa notatum

(quid non sentit amor?) primi vidistis amanteS,

, et vocis fecistis iter; tutaeque per illud

murmure blanditiae minimo transire solebant. u
