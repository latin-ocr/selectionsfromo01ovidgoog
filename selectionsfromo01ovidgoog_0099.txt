THE METAMORPHOSES

ECHO

(Met n, norw)

[In olden times Echo was not merely an empty
sound, but had a material body. Yet her voice had its
present limitations: she could never speak first, being
able only to echo the last words which she had heard.
Her love for Narcissus made her follow him through
the woods‚ longing to speak to him, but restricted by her
infirmity to reechoing part of what she overheard him
saying. One day, separated by chance from his comrades,
he shouted “Is any one here? ’' and she, following him
unseen at a distance, answered “Here! ” Then he, look-
ing in all directions, and much puzzled at not seeing
anybody, called out “ Comel’' and Echo answered
“ Come! ” Again he looked, but again in vain. “Why
dost thou flee from me? '’ he cried; “here let us meet,'’
and the answer carne with fervor, “ Let us meet.’' Then
from the thicket emerged, not one of his comradeS, but
Echo Now Narcissus had no love ior women, and he
no sooner saw Echo approaching him than he turned
away and disappeared.

Feeling the insult keenly, Echo withdrew to lonely
grottoes and there passed her life. Her love for Nar-
cissus however, still remained, and ceaseless {retting
wore her frame away. At last nothing remained but her
voice and her bones, The latter were changed to stone,
