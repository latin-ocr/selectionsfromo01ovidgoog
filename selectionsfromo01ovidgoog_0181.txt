THE METAMORPHOSES 119

Fain would Venus, when she saw the conspirators
actually taking their weapons into the senate-house on
the day fixed lor the deed, have hidden Caesar in a
cloud, even as she had, long ago, hidden Paris and
AeneaS, but Jove pointed out to her the impossibility
of obstructing the Fates. She must, so said the father
oi the gods, let that which was mortal fall by the hands
oi the assassins; then she could make him a god, forever
to be worshiped by the Romans.

Quickly she passed to the senate-house, and when the
conspirators had worked their will upon her beloved de-
scendant, she received his soul‚ and hore it with her to
heaven, and he became a god. But even he, looking

down upon the earth and seeing the mighty achieve- - ,

ments of Augustus, acknowledges that his son is greater
than himseli.].

Hic tamen accessit delubris advena nostris: ⁷45
Caesar in urbe sua deus est. Quem Marte togaque =
praecipuum 'non bella magis finita triumphis
resque domi gestae properataque gloria rerum
in sidus vertere novum stellamque comantem,
quarn sua progenies. Neque enim de Caesaris actis ⁷50
ullum maius opuS, quarn quod pater exstitit huius.
Scilicet aequoreos plus est domuisse Britannos
perque papyriferi septemflua flumina Nili
victrices egisse rates Numidasque rebelles
Cinyphiumque Iubam Mithridateisque tumentem ⁷55
nominibus Pontum populo adiecisse Quirini
et multos meruisse, aliquos egisse triumphos,
quam ¹tantum genuisse virum? ¹Quo praeside rerum
humano generi, superi, favistis abunde.
