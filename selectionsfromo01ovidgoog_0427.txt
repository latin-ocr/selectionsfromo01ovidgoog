THE CLASSICAL SERIES.
A Latin Grammar lor Schools

By Aunnaw Fiunruc Wusr, Ph. Ι)., LL. D,
Professor os Latin and Dean of the Graduate School,
Princeton University. 12mo. Cloth, 90 cents.

This book has been prepared ior schoolr and ior beginners
in Latin. lt is limited to the things most essential lor the young
pupil to know-the things he can grasp and use in reading his
school authors ’

The aim has been to state only the essentials, to detine thern
as simply as the laets warram, and to give as much explanation
as will fasten thern firmly in the mind. This involves 'the rejec-
tion oi all unnecessary technical terrns, unimportant exceptions,
formal and pedantic modes oi expression, and all refinements oi
doctrine that properly enter only alter the school stage. As iar
as possible, everything has been put in a concrete way, that the
pupil may see in his grammar the satisiying explanation oi living
usage, rather than the dissection ol a liieless material.

This grammar has kept strictly in view the developments in
the teaching ol Latin in our schools during the last ten years. lt
is planned to carry out lully the spirit oi the resolutions on the
subject adopted by the National Educational Association on
recommendation ol the American Philological Association. The
author has taught Latin in both the Western high school and
the Eastern academy, as well as in the college. During his whole
career, his relations with secondary school work, particularly with
the formulation ol the prograrn ol Latin studies recently adopted

by the National Educational Association, have heen most intimate
and constructive.
