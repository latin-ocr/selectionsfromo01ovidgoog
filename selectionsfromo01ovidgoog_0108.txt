52 SELECTIONS FROM OVID

. ATLAS AND PERSEUS
(Met. iv, 631-662)

[Equipped by the help of Minerva and Mercury with
winged shoes, a magic wallet, and a short curved sword‚
Perseus, son of Jupiter and Danae, had succeeded in
killing the Gorgon Medusa. This monster was the
daughter of the sea-god Phorcys. Her hair consisted of

, serpents, and any one who looked upon her face was

turned to stone. Perseus had 'cut off the head, which
even after death retained its former power, and was
carrying it with him, when on his way home he asked

. lodging and reireshment of the giant Atlas. “ It is a

son of Jove who makes this request,'’ ’said Perseus, “ if
thou· hast regard ior noble birth.” But Atlas, who had

apples of gold in his orchard, remembered an oracle ’ ,

which said that some day a son of Jove would rob
him, and suspecting Perseus he attempted t0 drive him
away. Whereupon Perseus, to punish him for his in-
hospitality, turned the face of Medusa toward him, and
the vast frame of Atlas was changed to the mountain
which still bears his name] ’

Hic hominum cunctis ingenti corpore praestans
Iapetionides Atlas fuit. Ultima tellus
rege sub hoo et pontus erat, qui Solis anhelis
aequora subdit equis, et fessos excipit axes.
Mille greges illi totidemque armenta per herbas ⁴ 635
errabant, et humum vicinia nulla premebant.
Arboreae frondes auro radiante nitentes
ex auro ramos ex auro poma tegebant.
