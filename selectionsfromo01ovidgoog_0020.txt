of his other writings. It is nothing more or less than a
didactic poem on the art of love, which appeared in three
books in 2 or 1 B. c. under the name of Ars Amatoria. ln
the first two books he drills men in the various, sometimes
extremely dubious artS, by the practise of which they may

love, showing how one finding himself in love can win
freedom once more. Between the composition of the Ars
Amatoria and that of the Remedia Amoris the poem entitled
M edicamirra Facier' is probably to be placed.

of two works of much wider scope and more serious pre-
tensions. These are the Metamorphoses and the Fasti. In
the former, which consists of fifteen books, a very long
series of myths of transformation have been welded into
a seemingly organic whole; in the latter we bave a poetical
version of the Roman calendar, with descriptions of the
various festivals and speculations as to their origin. The
greater part of the material of the Metamorphoses has been
drawn from Greek mythology, but in the latter part of the
work, where the poet deals with Roman legendS, a decidedly
patriotic element may be noticed. In the Fasti this patriotic
element is the dominant motive. The festivals, intimately

connected as they were with the history of Rome, touched
